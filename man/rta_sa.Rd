\value{
A numeric vector with the subsurface bi-hemispherical ('r', 
unitless) or hemispherical-directional ('rrs', 1/sr) water-leaving 
reflectance.
}
\description{
This function calculates the subsurface bi-hemispherical and 
hemispherical-directional water-leaving reflectance over optically deep 
or optically shallow waters.
}
\details{
In Hydrology Optics, the bi-hemispherical and hemispherical-
-directional reflectances are commonly named irradiance refelctance ("R" or 
"Rho") and remote sensing reflectance ("Rrs"), respectively. Those are two 
apparent optical properties of the medium. This function uses semi-analytical 
parametrizations to calculate their subsurface values, i.e., at depth 0 just 
below the water surface. The lower case names are used to indicate the 
subsurface quantities. Those quantities can be propagated into air, just 
above the water surface, with the function \code{propagate_r}.

An optically deep medium is equivalent of a semi-infinite medium, i.e., the 
bottom depth is infinite and has no contribution to the water-leaving 
reflectance. Optically shallow water are defined as the complement, when 
there is "measurable" influence of bottom albedo (bi-hemispherical 
reflectance).

Model "Albert-Mobley03" is used as default. It implements the equations and 
coefficients provided in Albert & Mobley (2003). The model includes an 
extended range of water medium properties, the effect of wind speed and 
include specific coefficients for "rho" and "rrs".

Model "Lee98" is also available. It implements the equations and coefficients
provided in Lee et al. (1998), with the corrections of Lee et al. (1999). The 
model is specifically parametrized for "rrs", and "rho" is calculated (with a 
warning) by assuming that the diffuse subsurface hemispherical-directional 
water-leaving reflectance is Lambertian.

Both models can be used to calculate 'rrs' at off-nadir observation. The 
model "Lee98" requires that the backscattering of particles (bbp) be provided 
separately in case of off-nadir observation. The "Albert-Mobley03" also 
allows to calculate off-zenith illumination, while the model of "Lee98" is an
average fit to three Sun zenith angles (0, 30 and 60 degrees, in air).

If the arguments passed to the function are outside the range used for 
parametrization of the specific model, values will be return with a warning 
of extrapolation beyond model domain.

Note that although the base data for the parametrization of both models 
includes the inelastic scattering (vibrational Raman from water and 
fluorescence from pigments and dissolved organic carbon), the semi-analytical
approximations do not model those processes. Simulations therefore should 
present higher errors when those processes are important contributors, 
particularly pigment fluorescence will produce a spectrally localized error.
